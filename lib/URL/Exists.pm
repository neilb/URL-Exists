=head1 NAME

URL::Exists - function that returns true if URL is present

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use URL::Exists qw/ url_exists /;

 if (url_exists($url)) {
    ...
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is useful where you're only interested in whether the
file referenced by a URL is present, and don't actually care about
the contents.

At the moment it just supports HTTP URLs, but I may add other
schemes, if there's any demand / interest.
